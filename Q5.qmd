## Exercise 5

For each of the following code fragments, write down was a potentially useful null hypothesis and null generating mechanism would be.

a. `cl` is categorical and `x1` is numeric.

```
ggplot(data) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=cl, y=x1))
```

b. `temp` is the temperature of stars and is thought to have a skewed distribution.

```
ggplot(stars, aes(temp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

c. `rooms` is an integer variable, `perc` is a percentage (or count/frequency), `miss` is a logical variable indicating the value was missing or not. 

```
ggplot(housing, aes(x=rooms, y=perc, fill = miss)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

d. `height` and `weight` are quantitative variables, `sport` is categorical.

```
ggplot(olympics, aes(x = height, 
                     y = weight,  
                     colour = sport)
      ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

e. `.resid` are residuals from a linear model fit.

```
ggplot(housing, aes(sample = .resid)) +
    geom_qq() +
    geom_qq_line() 
```
