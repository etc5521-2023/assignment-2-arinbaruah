## Exercise 4

A very successful 2023 Women's World Cup soccer was held in Australia and New Zealand in the last two months. Data from the last one held in 2019 can be downloaded from R using the package `StatsBombR`. The data for the Australia vs Brazil match have been downloaded and processed and made available in the file `aus_brazil.rda`. The match was played on June 14, 2019, in Stade de la Mosson, in France, and Australia won 3-2. This question explores the match data. It will help if you install these packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(rvest)
library(StatsBombR)
library(SBpitch)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
load("data/aus_brazil.rda")
```

A really nice introduction to working with the data is available [here](https://statsbomb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Working-with-R.pdf). 

a. Make a plot of shots on goal made by each team that looks like the following, and include your cleanly written code. (Note: 1. `location` has the position from which passes were made, in the form of an array. You can access the x and y values using `location.x` and `location.y`. 2. The positions have been processed so both teams are playing from left to right, so that it is easy to compare their play.)


Answer A

In order to visualise the shots on goal, we will filter the data with the following shot outcomes:

1. __Shots which led to goals__.
2. __Shots which were saved by the goalkeeper__.

The above two shot outcomes can be considered as "shots on goal" and will be visualised on the pitch through the code below.

```{r}
#| label: fig-goal
#| fig-cap: "Total shots on goal"
on_goal_conditions <- c("Goal","Saved")
shots_on_goal <- aus_brazil %>%
filter(shot.outcome.name %in% (on_goal_conditions)) %>% 
  select(c(location.x,location.y,team.name,player.name)) %>% mutate(team_name = case_match(team.name,"Australia Women's"~"Australia (Matildas)",
                                                                                          "Brazil Women's"~"Brazil (Seleção)"))


pl1 <- create_Pitch() +
geom_point(data = shots_on_goal, aes(x = location.x, y = location.y,color=team_name),size=5) + 
  labs(color="Team name",
       title = "Australia Vs Brazil, Shots on target", 
       subtitle = "Stadium De La Mosson, France,Women's World Cup, 2019") + 
  scale_y_reverse() + coord_fixed(ratio = 105/100) + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c('#FFCD00','Blue')) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") 

pl1
```

Figure @fig-goal illustrates the number of shots on target in the match of Australia Vs Brazil for the Women's World Cup. Following are the key observations:

1. There were a total of 8 shots on target from both the sides.
2. Of these 8 shots, Australia shot 5 goals on target while Brazil shot 3 goals on target.
3. The above analysis can be further confirmed through the google analytics and can be referred to [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=australia+vs+brazil+women%27s+worldcup+2019&client=safari&sca_esv=563943516&rls=en&sxsrf=AB5stBiFbjHF5qvMujaWoiD1OnnyX9Bmpg%3A1694243015849&ei=xxj8ZOevM-C02roP8Im9mAI&ved=0ahUKEwinr_2I-5yBAxVgmlYBHfBEDyMQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=australia+vs+brazil+women%27s+worldcup+2019&gs_lp=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&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#sie=m;/g/11gxvrqfj4;2;/m/01kglk;dt;fp;1;;;). 


b. Summarise the shots for each country by player. Would you say that shots were a team effort or dominated by certain players?

Answer B

```{r}
#| label: fig-playershot
#| fig-cap: "Number of shots by each player of each team"
total_shots <- aus_brazil %>%
filter(shot.outcome.name != is.na(shot.outcome.name)) %>% 
  select(c(location.x,location.y,team.name,player.name,player.id)) %>% mutate(team_name = case_match(team.name,"Australia Women's"~"Australia (Matildas)",
                                                                                          "Brazil Women's"~"Brazil (Seleção)"))

total_shots_grouped <- total_shots %>% group_by(team_name,player.name) %>% mutate("Shot_incident" = 1) %>% summarise(Total_shots = sum(Shot_incident))
pl2 <- ggplot(data = total_shots_grouped,aes(x = reorder(player.name,Total_shots),y = Total_shots)) + 
  geom_col(color='black') + geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, Total_shots >= 2,team_name == "Australia (Matildas)"),fill = "#FFCD00") + geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, Total_shots >= 2,team_name == "Brazil (Seleção)"),fill = "blue")+ coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~team_name,scales = "free_y") + theme_classic() + labs(y = "Number of shots",x = "Player")
pl2
```
@fig-playershot illustrates the number of shots registered by each player of each country. Following are our key observations:

1. There were a total of 21 shots registered by the 2 teams. Of these 21 shots, 11 were attributed to Brazil while the remaining 10 were attributed to Australia.
2. A total of 7 players from Australia registered shots while 8 players from Brazil registered shots.
3. It can be observed that two players of Australia, namely Samantha May Kerr and Tameka Yallop had higher shots than the rest of the team. Kerr was attributed with 3 shots while Yallop with 2 shots. 
4. On the other hand, there were 3 players of Brazil with 2 shots on target while the rest of the team had registered one shot.
5. Based on our analysis, __we can say that there were certain players in the Australian team who dominated the shots in the match__.
6. For Brazil however, __we can say that the shots were contributed nearly uniformly from the entire team__. 


c. Now let's take a look at passes. The location from which passes are made could be characteristic of a team. Make a lineup to test whether the position from which a pass was made was different between Australia and Brazil. Conduct a visual inference analysis to determine if the actual plot can be distinguished from the null plots. Report your $p$-value, after asking 8 of your friends to judge your lineup, and summarise your findings. 
d. The type of passes can also be characteristic of a team's play. Explore this with the variable `pass.length`, using a visual inference analysis.
